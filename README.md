The Backend Protection System (BPS) is a secure reverse proxy that validates API keys and forwards requests to your backend. It handles authentication via the backend response, issuing API keys upon successful login. BPS also protects against brute-force attacks by blocking IPs with repeated invalid attempts, ensuring secure access.
